Software to automatically segment brain tumors from pre-operative MRI scans, compute their characteristics (e.g., volume, location), and generate a standardized report.
The software was introduced in the article "Brain tumor preoperative surgery imaging: models and software solutions for
segmentation and standardized reporting", which has been accepted in [Frontiers in Neurology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology).  
Version 1.0 corresponds to the software as it was when the article was submitted, while version 1.1 is an improvement providing a more user-friendly graphical user interface.
